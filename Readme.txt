	This project demonstrates the interaction of Android app with a remote database. The projects name is AskJson.
	The project built on the client-server technology. The client part is the Android app. The server part is a HTTP server that interacts with the database.  Accordingly, the project consists of two parts. One part of the project is an Android project, the second is a PHP project.
	 As the development environment was used NetBeans IDE 8.01.  Android application written in Java. The server application written on the PHP language. To test  the application was  used a standard Android emulator. The project was also tested on the emulator Genymotio 2.3.1 and on a real device Huawei 9500. As the server was used Apache 2.4.10 HTTP server /PHP 5.5.15/MySql 5.0.11.
	In this project I have used the MySQL Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) to create a database.To manage MySQL server was used the browser-based MySQL adminisration tools, phpMyAdin 4.2.7.1.Databases can be created using the script mytest.sql
	To connect to the HTTP server the Android app uses  an absolute URL http://192.168.1.3:7070/askJson/askjson_input.php.

	The client and server communicate using the JSON protocol.
